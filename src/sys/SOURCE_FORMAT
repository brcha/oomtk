== File extensions ==

*.S   = assembler source (with the exception of arch/*/ldscript.S)
*.c   = C source
*.cpp = C++ source
*.h   = C/C++ header

== File naming ==

File names are all lowercase. C++ headers contain only one class (possibly with a few
helper classes) and there is a wrapper header whose name is the same as that of the
class which is located in include/OOMTK.

== C types naming ==

All C types (typedefs and structs) are all lowercase, words separated with underscore
and ending with underscore t. For example: uint32_t, multiboot_info_t, ...

== C++ classes naming ==

All C++ classes are with uppercased words, beginning with an O. For example: OProcess,
OKernelOutputStream, ...
    
C++ interfaces (very abstract classes) begin with an I. For example: ISortable
