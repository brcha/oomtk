Building a cross compile tool chain is a serious pain in the neck. The
main issue is that there is a circular dependency between gcc and
libc. Because of this circular dependency, the build MUST proceed in
the following order:

    1. build binutils
    2. build a subset of GCC that does not rely on access to libc
       headers
    3. build libc using that GCC
    4. build the production version of GCC
    5. Set up some required symlinks for gcc.

At each stage, the result of the previous stage must be installed
before proceeding further.

This sequence is painful, convoluted, and slow, but it is reliable.

The symlinks part deals with the fact that the directory tree
containing the cross compiler driver programs is not the target
tree. The symlinks allow GCC to locate other components such as LD and
AS.
